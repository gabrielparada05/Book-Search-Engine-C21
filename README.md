# Book-Search-Engine

## Description
The app is a Google Books API search engine that allows users to search for books and save their searches to the backend. The app is currently built using a RESTful API and the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, and Node.js). The motivation behind refactoring the app to use a GraphQL API with Apollo Server is to improve the efficiency and flexibility of data fetching and modification. GraphQL allows clients to request only the specific data they need, reducing over-fetching and under-fetching of data. Apollo Server is a popular GraphQL server implementation that provides tools and features for building GraphQL APIs.The problem that refactoring to a GraphQL API solves is the need for more efficient and flexible data fetching. With a RESTful API, clients often have to make multiple requests to fetch related data or receive more data than they need. GraphQL solves this problem by allowing clients to specify their data requirements in a single request.

-Install dependencies: Users need to navigate to the project directory in their terminal or command prompt and run the command npm install or yarn install to install all the required dependencies for the project. This will ensure that all the necessary packages are installed and ready to use.

-Set up the database: Since the app uses MongoDB as the database, users need to have MongoDB installed and running on their local machine or have access to a MongoDB database. They should create a new database and configure the connection details in the project's configuration files, such as the .env file or a config.js file.

-Start the server: Users can start the server by running the command npm start or yarn start in the project directory. This will start the Node.js/Express.js server and make it accessible at a specified port (usually localhost:3000).

-Access the app: Users can open a web browser and navigate to localhost:3000 (or the specified port) to access the app. They will be able to use the search functionality to search for books using the Google Books API.

-Sign up and log in: To save book searches and access personalized features, users need to sign up for an account. They can click on the "Sign Up" link or button and provide the required information. After signing up, they can log in using their credentials.

-Save book searches: Once logged in, users can perform book searches using the search bar. They can click on the "Save" button next to a book to save it to their account. Saved books can be accessed later in the app.

Explore additional features: Users can explore other features of the app, such as viewing their saved books, editing their profile, or logging out.
